# Game

Thanks to Laura's question after my final presentation, that gave me the idea for this game.

## How it Works

After starting the game, you are presented with a random Wikipedia article and its summary. It is your goal to find a song that matches this Wikipedia article as close as possible with its lyrics. Enter the song and artist name in each of the text-fields. When you press "Submit", your song gets searched and processed like every other song in the database. Meanwhile, a bot also selects a song from the 25'000 Songs, that are in the database. When the process is finished, you will be prompted with a screen, that shows you the distance between the embeddings from your song choice to the wikipedia article. The same goes for the bot. Whoever is closer Winns!

## Disclaimer

This game has been coded in 1 day due to my limited time at the moment. You might experience crashes and unhandled exceptions, but those are to be expected. This game is mainly here to showcase the "tech" and interact in a fun way with it. Also im not a designer ;)
