# Game

Thanks to Laura's question after my final presentation, which gave me the idea for this game.

## How it Works

After starting the game, you are presented with a random Wikipedia article and its summary. Your goal is to find a song that matches this Wikipedia article as closely as possible with its lyrics. Enter the song and artist name in each of the text fields. When you press "Submit," your song gets searched and processed like every other song in the database. Meanwhile, a bot also selects a song from the 25,000 songs in the database. When the process is finished, you will be presented with a screen that shows the distance between the embeddings of your song choice and the Wikipedia article. The same goes for the bot. Whoever is closer wins!

## Disclaimer

This game was coded in 1 day due to my limited time at the moment. You might experience crashes and unhandled exceptions, but those are to be expected. This game is mainly here to showcase the "tech" and interact with it in a fun way. It is limited to 100 requests a day due to the use of the free API tier for Lyrics.com. Also, I'm not a designer ;)
