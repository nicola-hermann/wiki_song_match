## Initial Ideas

In the beginning my main idea was to do something with embeddings. A spacial representation of data just seemed interesting to me and wanted to have a go at this myself and pack it into a creative project. I searched for data, that is widely availlable and easy to process. I Wikipedia articles were the first thing that came to my mind. I quickly searched the web and found a python packege to retrieve them easily. 

Now I needed something that I can compare the articles with. Nothing really came to my mind at first but a few days later,  i had the idea to match songs to wikipedia articles.

## Getting the Embeddings

My main goal of this project was to let the algorithm do all the matching itself, without interference of a human. So i needed methods that require no labeling. Additionally, I wanted to use as many existing technologies, because the project seemed ambitious for a 3 credits module.

With those goals in mind, the only really effective way to compare songs to articles was via the lyrics. In order to create a good matching algorithm, the embeddings need to as homogeneous as possible
